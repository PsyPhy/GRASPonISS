The actual Grasp scientific task starts with a welcome screen that prompts the subject to press a button in order to start a block of trials:

CENTER( IMAGE(ready.bmp, 100) )

He or she is then guided to bring the head to an upright position with respect to the shoulders.
The halo around the subject's view into the virtual world changes color, from red when the head 
is tilted far from the upright position through yellow and green until it turns brighy cyan to
indicate that the head is at the proper orientation. A circular arrow may appear when the head
is far from the desired posture, giving the subject an indication of which way to tilt the head.

CENTER( Head too far left: IMAGE(leftFar.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftCloser.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftNear.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftGood.bmp, 100) :Head a right orientation )

A target orientation is then presented to the subject. 
This can be visual, in the form of a line of balls presented at the end of the tunnel.
Or the target orientation can be presented kinesthetically, by guiding the outstretched hand to the 
desired orientation by changing the color of a virtual tool.

CENTER( Visual Target: IMAGE(vTarget.bmp, 100)  Kinesthetic Target: IMAGE(kTargetFar.bmp, 100)  IMAGE(kTargetNear.bmp, 100)  IMAGE(kTargetGood.bmp, 100) )

The target disappears and the subject is prompted to tilt the head to a new orientation through the same system 
of halo colors and direction arrows as described previously.

CENTER( Head too far left: IMAGE(leftFar.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftCloser.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftNear.bmp, 100) IMAGE(leftGood.bmp, 100) :Head a right orientation )

The subject then reproduces the remembered target orientation, with or without visual feedback about the hand's orientation.

CENTER( IMAGE(vTool.bmp, 100) IMAGE(kTool.bmp, 100) )

The subject presses a button to validate the trial. A green sphere pops up to indicate that the trial was completed successfully, 
or a message appears to indicate that the block of trials has been completed.

CENTER( IMAGE(trialCompleted.bmp, 100)  IMAGE(blockCompleted.bmp, 100))

Note that a circular prompt with text instructions may appear at different times in response to different conditions.
For instance, a message will be generated if the subject does not maintain the head in the specified tilted position.
All possible messages are shown in Appendix II.
