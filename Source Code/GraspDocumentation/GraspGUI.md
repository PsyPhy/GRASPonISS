A user initiates Grasp activities by selecting his or her designated subject ID in the upper-left panel of GRASP@ISS:

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\Login.png, 400) )

Using a pull-down menu, the protocol for the pending sub-session is selected:

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\SelectSubsession.png, 400) )

Selecting the subsession protocol brings up a list of tasks to be executed in the defined order  
(the first task is automatically selected):

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\StartTask.png, 400) )

The panel on the right then guides the subject through the steps required by each task.
The panel may take one of four different forms.
First, the subject is presented with one or more pages of instructions. 
Once the instructions have been read the subject proceeds to the next step by pressing the 'Next' button.
It is also possible to return to the previous step (exept when at the first step) by pressing the 'Back' button.

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\Instruction.png, 200) )

The subject may then be prompted to launch a particular action. 
In the example shown here, the system is ready to perform the tracker alignment. 
The subject presses the 'Execute' button to initiate the action. 
He or she may also press 'Back' to return to the previous action or instruction. 
In exceptional cases, the subject may be told by POCC to press 'Skip' to move on to the next step without performing the action.

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\Execute.png, 200) )

Pressing 'Execute' typically causes a new program to execute, which will activate specific popup windows outside the GRASP@ISS main window.
When execution of the task terminates, focus will return to the GRASP@ISS main window and the termination status of the task is displayed.
If the task was successful, the subject will typically see the following message allowing them to confirm and move on to the following step (by pressing 'Next')
or to return and repeat the task (by pressing 'Back').

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\Success.png, 200) )

If the task did not complete successfully, an alert will be displayed that shows the error return code (in the 'Error Code' box) and 
that typically includes a graphical or text explanation of the error. Shown here is the generic message that may be used for any 
error condition, but more specific error messages may also be displayed. 

CENTER( IMAGE(GUIScreenshots\Alert.png, 200) )

In these circumstances, the subject is invited to repeat the task by pressing 'Retry'. 
If a second attempt also fails, the subject has the option to move on to the next step anyway, by pressing 'Ignore' 
or to repeat the entire task from the begining by pressing 'Restart'.

The full set of possible instruction, status and alert screens are included in the following sections.
