HEADER( *__Step 2: Acquire the Target Orientation__* )

- Once your head is aligned with your body (i.e. when the HALO is bright green), 
a yellow spherical target will appear. 
Raise your arm and point your hand such that the virtual laser-pointer falls on the target.

- Rotate your hand in a rolling motion around the axis of your arm until the virtual pointer 
and tool turn bright green. Memorise the hand orientation.
