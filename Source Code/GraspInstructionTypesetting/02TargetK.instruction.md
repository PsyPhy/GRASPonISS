HEADER( *__Step 2: Acquire the Target Orientation__* )

Once your head is aligned with your body (i.e. when the HALO is bright green), 
a yellow spherical target will appear. 
Raise your arm and point your hand such that the virtual laser-pointer falls on the target.

Rotate your hand in a rolling motion around the axis of your arm until the virtual pointer 
and tool turn bright green. Memorise the hand orientation.

When the target disappears, lower your arm to a neutral position on your lap.

__Note__: Please *__do not__* try to maintain the memorised roll orientation of the hand.
You should return your hand to the same neutral position on every trial.
