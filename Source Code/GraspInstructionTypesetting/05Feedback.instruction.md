In some of the trials a line of target balls will be projected from your hand towards the targets, 
allowing you to verify whether or not you correctly aligned your hand. On other trials you will see
only a single spherical projectile without any indication as to whether your hand was correctly aligned
to the memorised target orientation.

A green sphere appears briefly if the task sequence is completed correctly, regardless of the accuracy
of the hand's alignment to the target.
