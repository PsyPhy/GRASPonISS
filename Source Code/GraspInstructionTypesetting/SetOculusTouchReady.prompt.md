HEADER( __Set Oculus Touch Tracking__ )

Executing this task will set a flag to tell GRASP to use the Oculus system for tracking of the HMD, hand and chest.

- The Visual-Visual should work normally.
- The Visual-Manual and the Manual-Manual paradigms will work, where right left hand touch controller represents the position of the hand and the left hand touch controller tracks the chest.

This trackerless version allows for debugging of the user interface, procedures and operations without 
the need for connection to the GRIP hardware.
