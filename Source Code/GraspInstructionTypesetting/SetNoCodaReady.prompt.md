HEADER( __Set No GRIP Tracking__ )

Executing this task will set a flag to tell GRASP to use only the inertial tracking inside the Oculus.

- The Visual-Visual should work normally.
- The Visual-Manual and the Manual-Manual paradigms will work in a mode where tracking of the hand
is simulated with the mouse and arrow keys.

This trackerless version allows for debugging of the user interface, procedures and operations without 
the need for connection to the GRIP hardware.
