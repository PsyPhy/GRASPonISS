HEADER( *__Step 2: Acquire the Target Orientation__* )

Once your head is aligned with your body (i.e. when the HALO is bright green), 
a set of parallel bars will appear at the end of the tunnel, representing the target orientation.

CENTER( IMAGE(Pictures/VtargetBars.jpg, 400) )

Memorise the target orientation.

__Note__: Your hand must remain in the neutral position on your lap throughout the target presentation.
Please *__do not__* align your hand to the target orientation during target presentation or during the 
memory delay period.
