HEADER( *__Step 1: Straighten Head__* )

- If your head is laterally tilted with respect to the trunk, the HALO will be red:

- Look straight ahead so that the virtual laser pointer falls on the central target, 
then slowly straighten your head on your shoulders. 
This will make the HALO turn progressively from red to green:

- When the HALO pops to bright green, hold this position.
