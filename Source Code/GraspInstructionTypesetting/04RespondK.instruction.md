HEADER( *__Step 4: Align to Target__* )

- When the orange disk reappears, raise your arm and aim with the hand until the laser pointer falls on the disk.

- Rotate your hand in a rolling motion around the axis of your arm to the remembered target orientation.

__Note__: *In this phase the virtual tool gives no indication about the orientation of the hand around the roll axis.
You must rotate the hand to the __remembered__ orientation while pointing to the target in pitch and yaw.*

- With your left hand, press the center button on the Remote Control to validate your response 
once you think your hand is aligned with the memorised target.
