__Note__: Alignment of the CHESTMARKERS on the restraint plate is critical. 
Check that the top edge of the CHESTMARKERS is aligned with the edge of the 
plate nearest the deck of the ISS module and that the cable exits the support to your right when facing the plate.

- Check that the field of view of the TRACKER is free of obstructions.
